> Ever wondered about those mysterious roof boxes on top of the Nikhef
building, across the street from Science Parkâ€™s main building? As you may know,
it rarely snows in Amsterdam, so it is not where the scientists keep their
skis. So what do these boxes contain and why are they on top of a building?
Those simple, commercially available boxes are used for real science. They
cannot only be found at Nikhef, but also on the roofs of high schools in the
Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom and are used to get high school
kids excited about science. At the same time, they get some proper science done
on cosmic rays. Read on to learn more about this cool project called HiSPARC
(High School Project on Astrophysics Research with Cosmics).
